# Coding-Journey
I named this Coding-Journey because it has some of the things I have learned throughout my time exploring and trying out code.
It also involves some many project from the past. I first started out with some scripting languages and diving into web development such as: HTML/HTML 5 and CSS, Bash, C++, some Java, Python, very little Ruby at the moment. However I will continue to add code that I have had great success with, as well as struggles and even failures.
